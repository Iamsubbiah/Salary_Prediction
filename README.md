# Salary_Prediction
Predict entry-level salaries using machine learning based on features like education, skills, job role, and experience. This project uses regression models and visualizations to understand how different factors influence starting salaries.

💼 Predicting Entry-Level Salaries using Machine Learning
📝 Project Description:
This project predicts entry-level salaries based on key features like education, experience, job role, and skills using Linear Regression. While salary is a continuous variable, we use regression modeling to estimate salary amounts based on input attributes.

It demonstrates how even a basic regression model can provide valuable insights into the factors that influence starting salaries in the job market.

🧠 Tech Stack:
Python

Scikit-learn – for regression modeling

Seaborn & Matplotlib – for data visualization

Pandas & NumPy – for data preprocessing

📊 Features Used:
Education Level

Years of Experience

Test_score

Interview_Score

🔁 Workflow:
Load and explore the salary dataset.

Clean and preprocess the data (handle categories, missing values).

Visualize feature relationships using plots.

Train a Linear Regression model on relevant features.

Predict the entry-level salary for new data inputs.

Evaluate model performance using metrics like MAE and R² score.

Visualize prediction performance and salary trends.

🎯 Outcome:
The model helps estimate expected starting salaries, allowing job seekers and recruiters to better understand the value of different skills, roles, and educational backgrounds in the current job market.

📈 Visual Insights:
Higher education levels generally lead to higher predicted salaries.

Skills like Python, SQL, or Data Analysis show strong influence on salary.

Experience has a noticeable positive correlation with salary prediction.
